## Week 3 MVP: ***Find a safe way of allowing secured access without providing their password every time***

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to authenticate once with email and password, so that I can access my snippets without writing my password every time
### Functional Requirements Week 3
- The user provides their email and password to authenticate and receives a token in exchange
- The token allows the user to authorize further requests to the API without repeating their password
- Users can access secured resources with their token just as they could using their password in the previous epic
- The token expires after 24 hours
- Email and password should be passed in the Authorization header of the request
- Use JWTs to provide authorization

## Week 2 MVP
### User Stories Week 2
#### Encryption
- As a user, I want all snippets to be encrypted before being saved into the database, so that I feel confident my code canâ€™t be stolen if the database is compromised
- As a user, I want the snippet to be decrypted before it is returned from the API, so that I can actually read it

### Authentication
- As a user, I want to make an account with my email and password, so that I can have an identity on Snippr.io

### Functional Requirements Week 2
#### Encryption MVP
- When a POST request is made to /snippet, the code content of the body should be encrypted before saving in the datastore
- When a GET request is made to /snippet (or any subroute), the code content should be decrypted before returning

### Authentication MVP
- When a POST request is made to /user with email and password in the body, the password should be salted and hashed before the user is saved in the data store.
- ***Bonus***: When a GET request is made to /user, only the user whose correct credentials are provided should be returned. The response must not contain the password (or a hash of the password). This is therefore a protected endpoint and can only be accessed if email and password are provided with the request.

## Week 1 MVP
### User Stories Week 1
As a user, I can add a snippet to the data store, so that I can look it up again when I need it.
```bash
POST/snippet/8 
Returns
{
    "id": 8,
    "language": "C++",
    "code": int main (){
        std::cout << "Hello, Wolrd! << std::endl;
    }
  }
```
As a user, I can request a snippet by its ID, so that I can see the snippet again
```bash
GET/snippet/8 
Returns
{
    "id": 8,
    "language": "C++",
    "code": int main (){
        std::cout << "Hello, Wolrd! << std::endl;
    }
  }
```
### Functional Requirements Week 1
1. Users can make POST request to /snippet to create a new snippet
2. Users can make a GET request to /snippet to get all the snippets currently in the data store
3. Users can make a GET request to e.g. /snippet/3 to retrieve the snippet with the ID of 3
4. ***Bonus***: Users can make a GET request to e.g. /snippet?lang=python to retrieve all the Python snippets
